# code-graph-builder

Code Graph Builder is a tool that allows users to create graphs of nodes and edges. Nodes have a code equivalent, and when certain edges are created, users can generate code based on the nodes and edges they have created.

This tool is useful for developers who want to visualize their code and see how different parts of their code interact with each other. It can also be used to generate code from scratch.

Code Graph Builder is still under development, but it is already a powerful tool for developers who want to improve their understanding of their code.
